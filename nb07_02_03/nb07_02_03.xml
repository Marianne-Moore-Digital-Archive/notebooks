                        the marginal note of lines 14-16, where it forks into two lines, one of

                        line drawn across line 17, into a vertical line next to the text of lines

                        parenthesis on line 37, also in pencil. Parentheses enclose "innermost" and
                        "interior" on lines 24-25. MM strikes out lines 28-29 with 5 diagonal pencil
                        strokes. A vertical pencil stroke is placed to the left of the parenthesis
                        on lines 36-37. The sentence in quotation marks at the end of lines 37-38 is
