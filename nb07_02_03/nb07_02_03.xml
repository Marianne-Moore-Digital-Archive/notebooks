               to the left of the marginal note of lines
               14-16, where it forks into two lines, one of
               which is lightly drawn across line 14 and the
               other of which turns, at the line drawn
               across line 17, into a vertical line next to
               the text of lines 17-26. From this line MM
               draws another line, still in pencil, starting
               at line 27, that arcs out leftward and down
               to connect to the opening parenthesis on line
               37, also in pencil. Parentheses enclose
               "innermost" and "interior" on lines 24-25. MM
               strikes out lines 28-29 with 5 diagonal

               placed to the left of the parenthesis on
               lines 36-37. The sentence in quotation marks
