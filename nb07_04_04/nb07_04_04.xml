                        For ease of proofing, I mark passages written vertically or in clusters independent of regular 
                        horizontal lineation in green, or if additional colors are needed to distinguish, blue, red or 
                        yellow. MM’s use of ditto marks will be replicated as "—that is, by a single set of quotation 
                        marks.

She responds “I was born free, and to enjoy that freedom have I chosen the solitude of these fields . . . those whom my eyes have captivated, my tongue has undeceived: and if hope be the food of desire, I gave none to Chrysostom or to any other person, so neither can his [or others’] death . . . be justly imputed to my cruelty, but rather to their own obstinate despair” (translated by John Ormsby, 1885).</note></l>
