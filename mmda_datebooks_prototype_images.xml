         <!-- 
            To go image-by-image, I used the same basic code structure as before but with a few changes:
            adding div elements around the pb and other contents, adding @type to pb to be able to render different
            page types appropriately, and using date@cert for uncertain dates.
            
            For this example I am imagining two overlapping photos of a notebook laid open flat, pages down so the front and back cover are 
            both showing in the same pictures, followed by a single image of a blank page on which MM has written her name, so that 
            the first div has two @facs values and the second div has one. There is no longer any need for @facs in the 
            pb element.
            
           -->
         <div facs="0001.jpg 0002">
            <!-- 
              I've added in @type to the pb element now, such that if you wanted to you could create values for any kind of 
            specific page-level rendering needed. I've used here cover and blank, but recto, verso, insert, or others could 
            also be example values. For a reading viewer this would later help us make the transcriptions look more like
            the original layouts.  

            Note that the second pb element here is empty, because in this hypothetical example the back cover is blank.
            -->
            <pb type="cover"/>
            <head>1900 Calendar</head>
            <pb type="cover"/>

                  <!-- Here I've added @cert=unknown to indicate that the supplied value is a guess. The default
                  values for @cert are low, medium, high, unknown, but we could devise whatever values worked best
                  for recording this kind of information. -->
